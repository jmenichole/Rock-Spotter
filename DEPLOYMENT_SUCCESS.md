✅ **Demo Mode Active** - Using mock data for immediate functionality  
✅ **Fixed Routing** - Corrected base paths for proper Vercel deployment

### 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Node.js 22.x) 
- **Domain**: Custom Vercel subdomain (upgradeable to custom domain)
- **Performance**: Optimized build with gzip compression (~106KB JS, ~5KB CSS)
- **Security**: HTTPS enabled, credentials secured in .env (not committed)

### 🛡️ Security Status

✅ **Environment Variables** - Properly secured in .env (gitignored)  
✅ **No Exposed Credentials** - MongoDB URI and JWT secret are local only  
✅ **Production Ready** - Ready for environment variables in Vercel dashboard  

### 📈 Next Steps for Full Production

To enable full backend functionality (real user accounts, database storage):

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard**:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://rockspotter:wIVyuRnSur6EJHZp@cluster0.0z3jtr.mongodb.net/rock-spotter?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   JWT_SECRET=19b102082b7930d043fe88bf9f40d54bd1f1d39c1d97546f8fe8668e8b03a456fba60e2031307253b7cb3bd22803667b85fd9df023484b58187be15725daa4b7
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Configure MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Whitelist Vercel IP addresses: `0.0.0.0/0` (for serverless)
   - Verify database user `rockspotter` has read/write permissions

### 🎯 Current Status

### 📈 Next Steps for Full Production

To enable full backend functionality (real user accounts, database storage):

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_32_character_string
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Configure MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Whitelist Vercel IP addresses

   - Update connection string

3. **Enable API Functions** (optional):
   - Uncomment API routes in vercel.json
   - Deploy backend serverless functions

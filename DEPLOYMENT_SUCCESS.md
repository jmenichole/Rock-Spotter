### 📈 Next Steps for Full Production

To enable full backend functionality (real user accounts, database storage):

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://rockspotter:wIVyuRnSur6EJHZp@cluster0.0z3jtr.mongodb.net/rock-spotter?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   JWT_SECRET=19b102082b7930d043fe88bf9f40d54bd1f1d39c1d97546f8fe8668e8b03a456fba60e2031307253b7cb3bd22803667b85fd9df023484b58187be15725daa4b7
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Configure MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Whitelist Vercel IP addresses: `0.0.0.0/0` (for serverless)
   - Verify database user `rockspotter` has read/write permissions
